# Admin PHP Starter (Bootstrap 4.5.2)

A minimal admin UI scaffold in plain PHP for a women's fashion store.

## Features
- Sidebar + Topbar layout
- Dashboard KPIs
- Products list & product form (variants stub)
- Orders list & order view timeline
- Customers list
- Settings page
- Simple session login (demo)

## Run locally
1. Put this folder into your PHP server root (e.g., `htdocs/admin-php-starter` for XAMPP).
2. Start Apache (and MySQL if you plan DB).
3. Visit `http://localhost/admin-php-starter/login.php`.
4. Log in with any email/password (demo), you'll be redirected to the admin.

## Notes
- All data is demo (arrays). Wire up `get_pdo()` in `config.php` to your real DB and replace demo arrays with queries.
- All CDNs use HTTPS to avoid mixed-content issues.
- Tested with PHP 7.4+.
